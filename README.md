# Terraform

Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that allows users to define and provision data center infrastructure using a declarative configuration language.

## Getting Started

Before you begin automating with Terraform, follow these steps:
1. **Understand Your Resources**: Manually create resources in the cloud and explore the cloud console to understand how resources are created.
2. **Plan Your Automation**: Once you have a good understanding of the resources, start automating the process using Terraform.

## Key Concepts

### Resource Group
A **Resource Group** is a collection of resources that are managed together.

## Common Terraform Commands

Hereâ€™s a list of commonly used Terraform commands:

### Initialization
- **`terraform init`**: Initializes a Terraform working directory, downloading the necessary provider plugins and setting up the backend.

### Planning and Applying
- **`terraform plan`**: Creates an execution plan, showing what actions Terraform will take to match the configuration.
- **`terraform apply`**: Applies the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration, creating or updating resources as necessary.

### Formatting and Validation
- **`terraform fmt`**: Formats Terraform configuration files to a canonical format and style.
- **`terraform validate`**: Validates the Terraform configuration files for syntax errors and other issues.

### State Management
- **`terraform state`**: Manages the Terraform state file, allowing you to view, modify, or remove resources from the state.
  - **`terraform state list`**: Lists all resources in the current Terraform state.
  - **`terraform state show`**: Displays detailed information about a specific resource in the Terraform state.
  - **`terraform state rm`**: Removes a resource from the Terraform state.
  - **`terraform state mv`**: Moves a resource from one address to another in the Terraform state.

### Workspaces
- **`terraform workspace`**: Manages multiple workspaces, allowing you to have different states for different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).
  - **`terraform workspace new`**: Creates a new workspace.
  - **`terraform workspace select`**: Switches to a specified workspace.
  - **`terraform workspace list`**: Lists all available workspaces.
  - **`terraform workspace delete`**: Deletes a specified workspace.

### Resource Management
- **`terraform import`**: Imports existing infrastructure into Terraform management.
- **`terraform taint`**: Marks a resource for recreation during the next apply.
- **`terraform untaint`**: Removes the taint mark from a resource.

### Debugging and Visualization
- **`terraform show`**: Displays the current state of the Terraform-managed infrastructure.
- **`terraform graph`**: Generates a visual representation of the dependency graph of the resources.

### Miscellaneous
- **`terraform output`**: Displays the output values defined in the Terraform configuration.
- **`terraform console`**: Opens an interactive console for evaluating expressions and inspecting the Terraform state.

## Notes

- Always ensure you have a clear understanding of the resources you want to create before automating with Terraform.
- Use `terraform fmt` to maintain consistent formatting across your configuration files.
